 * Resolve after `ms`, or immediately when `signal` aborts.

 * When a `signal` is passed the abort listener is always removed so repeated
 * calls do not accumulate listeners on a long-lived signal. Resolves (rather
 * than rejects) on abort — callers treat abort as "wake up early," not as a
 * failure; callers that want to unwind should check the signal themselves.
